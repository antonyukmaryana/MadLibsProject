<h1>At The Arcade!</h1>
<p>When I go to the arcade with my @Model.PluralNoun there are lots of games to play. I spend lots of time there with my friends.</p>
<p>In the game X-Men you can be different @Model.PluralNoun. The point 
of the game is to @Model.Verb every robot. You also need to save people. Then you can go to the next level.</p>
<p>In the game Star Wars you are Luke Skywalker
and you try to destroy every @Model.Noun . In a car racing/motorcycle racing game you need to beat every computerized vehicle that you are 
@Model.IngVerb) against.</p>
<p>There are a whole lot of other cool games. When
you play some games you win @Model.PluralNoun for certain scores. Once you're done you can
cash in your tickets to get a big @Model.Noun.</p>
<p> You can save your @Model.PluralNoun for another time. When I went to this arcade I didn't believe how much fun it would be. So far I have had a lot of fun every time I've been to this great arcade! </p>
